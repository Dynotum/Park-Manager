# Park Manager

# Project 

## Chapter 1
Create a program that simulates a sign at the entrance of Mesozoic Eden. 
* The sign is simulated by printing output to the console. 
* The sign should display a welcome message, the opening and closing hours, and a short safety message.

##### **_Dinosaur profile generator_**

As part of your responsibilities in Mesozoic Eden, you are tasked with creating an extensive database of all the dinosaurs living in the park. For now, you only need to complete the first step: a profile generator. These profiles will not only help in keeping track of our prehistoric residents but also provide essential data for scientific study, healthcare, diet management, and visitor engagement.

In this project, we will focus on developing a program that can **_model an individual dinosaur’s profile_**.

The profile should include the following characteristics:

    Name
    Age
    Species
    Diet (carnivore or herbivore)
    Weight

Each characteristic should be stored as a variable within the program. Here’s your chance to get creative and think about the kind of dinosaur you want to describe. Is it a towering T-Rex or a friendly Stegosaurus? Maybe it’s a swift, scary Velociraptor or a mighty Triceratops?

Once you have declared and assigned values to these variables, the program should print out a complete profile of the dinosaur. 

The output can be something like: 

`"Meet [Name], a [Age]-year-old [Species]. As a [Diet], it has a robust weight of [Weight] kilograms.".`

##### **_Dino meal planner_**

As a zookeeper in Mesozoic Eden, the crucial tasks include planning the meals for our beloved dinosaurs. While we’re not using conditionals and loops yet, we can still calculate some basic requirements!

Develop a simple program to help the zookeepers plan the meal portions for different dinosaurs. The program should use the dinosaur’s weight to calculate how much food it needs to eat per meal.

If you need a bit more guidance, here’s how you can do it:

* Declare variables for the dinosaur’s weight and the proportion of its weight it needs to eat per day. For instance, if a dinosaur needs to eat 5% of its body weight daily, and it weighs 2,000 kg, it would need to eat 100 kg of food.
    Now, let’s say you feed the dinosaur twice a day.
* Declare a variable for the number of feedings and calculate how much food you need to serve per feeding. In this example, it would be 50 kg per feeding.
    Print out the result in a meaningful way – for example, “Our 2,000 kg dinosaur needs to eat 100 kg daily, which means we need to serve 50 kg per feeding.”
